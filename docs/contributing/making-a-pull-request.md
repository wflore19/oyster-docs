# Making a Pull Request

Some things to keep in mind when making a pull request:

- The target branch in our repository is `main`.
- Fill out the PR template accordingly.
- The name of the PR should:
  - Start with one of the following prefixes:
    - `feat`: A non-breaking change which adds functionality.
    - `fix`: A non-breaking change which fixes an issue.
    - `refactor`: A change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
    - `docs`: A change only to in-code or markdown documentation.
    - `test`: A change that adds missing tests.
    - `chore`: A change that is likely none of the above.
  - Be in all lowercase.
  - Start with a verb (ie: "add ...", "implement ...", "update ...").
  - Have an emoji at the end of it (we like color around here). 🔥
- Please check the
  ["allow edits from maintainers option"](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
  when creating your PR. This allows us to more easily collaborate with you on
  your work.
- Most PRs should be attached to an issue, so be sure to add this to the PR
  description:
  ```
  Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>.
  ```
