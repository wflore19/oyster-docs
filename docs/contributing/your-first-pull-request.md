# Your First Pull Request

It's time to get your first pull request in! We love quick wins, so this first
one should only take a few minutes. Here's what we want you to do:

1. Create a new branch.

   ```
   git checkout -b first-contribution
   ```

2. Add your GitHub username to the
   [`CONTRIBUTORS.yml`](https://github.com/colorstackorg/oyster/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.yml)
   file.
3. Push this change up to GitHub (ie: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`).
4. Create a pull request.
   1. The title can be: `chore: my first contribution ðŸš€`
   2. The description can be: `Added name to CONTRIBUTORS.yml!`
5. Here is an [example PR](https://github.com/colorstackorg/oyster/pull/417) in
   case you want to follow one!

Boom, you're all done! This should be approved and merged soon, and you'll
officially be an Oyster contributor! ðŸ¥³
