# Deciding What to Work On

You can start by browsing through our list of
[issues](https://github.com/colorstackorg/oyster/issues). Once you've decided on
an issue, leave a comment and wait to get approval from one of our codebase
admins - this helps avoid multiple people working on this same issue.

Most of our work comes from our
[product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/colorstackorg/projects/4) so if
there's something that interests you there that hasn't been converted into an
issue yet, feel free to ask about it.

## Proposing Ideas

If you have a feature request or idea that would improve our product, please
start a thread in our
[`#oyster`](https://colorstack-family.slack.com/channels/C06S0DBFD6X) channel in
Slack! If the maintainers see value in the idea, they will add it to our
[product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/colorstackorg/projects/4) or create an
[issue](https://github.com/colorstackorg/oyster/issues) directly.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please file a
[bug report](https://github.com/colorstackorg/oyster/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bug+%F0%9F%90%9E&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=)
directly!
