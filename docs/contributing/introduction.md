# Introduction

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! ü•≥ ColorStack is nothing
without its community and that certainly extends to the software that we build.
This is a big team effort!

## First Things First

The #1 reason that we decided to open source Oyster was so that ColorStack
members can learn from and eventually contribute to a real-world production
codebase. Everything we do is centered around our helping our members fulfuill
their dreams of becoming software engineers. That being said, in order to make
space for our community, we will only accept contributions from ColorStack
members. ‚ù§Ô∏è
