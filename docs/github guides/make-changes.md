# Make and Commit Changes

Now that you have your own branch, you can make changes to the codebase:

1. **Make your changes** using your preferred code editor.

2. **Stage your changes**:

```
git add <CHANGED_FILES>
```

Or to stage all changes

```
git add .
```

3. **Commit your changes**:

```
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message
```

Write a clear, concise commit message describing what you changed and why.

4. **Push your changes** to your fork on GitHub:

```
git push origin main
```

Remember to commit often and keep your commits focused on specific changes. This makes it easier to review and potentially revert changes if needed.
